# Introduction

## What is Minarca ?

Minarca is a data backup solution allowing to centralize the management of your backups. This solution has the advantage of being easy to install on a dedicated server and also allows you to easily install an agent called minarca-client on the computers to back up. 

Minarca is a hassle-free backup solution, including all the features you need to better serve your users. The minarca agent is available for all major platforms such as Windows Mac OS and Linux. This allows you to use a single solution to backup your entire computer system.

## Architecture

The Minarca backup solution consists of several components.

First, on the server side, a web application allows you to manage the backups of your users and to configure the access. This web interface also allows you to browse the backup and restore data from your web browser. This component is a modified version of Riffweb.

In addition to this web application, we also install another component called Minarca-shell that takes care of receiving incoming connections via the SSH protocol, validating the authentication and authorization of the user to make a backup, and also isolating each user and their repository.

The last component, named Minarca client, must be installed on the computers to be backed up. This component acts as an agent on the computer and takes care of coordinating the data backup to the Minarca server. Using this agent it is possible to select the files and directories to be backed up and the frequency of the backup.  The Minarca agent can be used via a user interface or command line.
