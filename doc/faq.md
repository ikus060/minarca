## Why are rdiff-backup packages downloaded from custom repository when rdiff-backup is in Debian?

The reason why the rdiff-backup packages are downloaded from our repository instead of using the ones provided by Debian is due to several factors. Firstly, Minarca server is designed to support multiple versions of rdiff-backup for backward compatibility. These versions include 1.2.8, 2.0.x, and soon 2.2.x. However, the packages distributed by Debian cannot be installed side-by-side, which is a requirement for Minarca's functionality.

Moreover, the packages distributed within Minarca are pre-compiled with a specific version of Python that is guaranteed to work in any Debian or Ubuntu distribution, regardless of the Python version provided by the operating system. This ensures compatibility across different environments.

Additionally, there are occasions when we need to apply additional patches to the original source code for compatibility reasons. While most of these patches are eventually merged upstream within a few months, we apply them directly to the packages distributed by Minarca to avoid any disruption for our end-users.

In summary, the rdiff-backup packages distributed by Minarca are specifically tailored and known to work seamlessly with Minarca, whereas the packages provided by Debian may not fulfill these requirements.
