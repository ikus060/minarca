## Why is my backup not running ?

For security measure, Minarca client on Windows is configured to only start when you have an open session. If you are not logged in to the computer, Minarca is not running the backup.

To overcome this limitation, you may manually change the configuration of the scheduler to run when you are not logged in. To do this:

1. Go to Start Menu
2. Search for "Task Scheduler"
3. Select "Minarca backup" task
4. Select "Run Whether user is logged on or not"
